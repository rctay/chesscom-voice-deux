# Chess.com Voice Commentary (improved)

As you might have found, the Chess.com Voice Commentary extension doesn't work and hasn't been updated for some time. I made some fixes to get it working, sharing it here so more people can benefit.

I do not claim any copyright, all copyright (eg. code, sounds) belong to Chess.com.
